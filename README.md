# Reproducibility project-
Reproducibility project with our own data 

Before starting the project, have your data formatted like the data [here](https://github.com/rfb-alfonzo/Reproducibility-Workflow/tree/main/Data)
The data has been formatted to include mean, sd, and tukey values
To get tukey values, use program StatistiX 8.1, copy and paste data sets for your groups and follow the program instructions for tukey values
The [bar graph codes](https://github.com/rfb-alfonzo/Reproducibility-Workflow/tree/main/Codes) are designed to work around this data format.

There are multiple strains of Xylella Fastidios and this project is observing the interactions of these strains grown in co-cultures.  
There are four groups that need to be graphed:
    Strains grown on Chloramphenicol plates extracted from the Planktonic Layer
    Strains grown on Chloramphenicol plates extracted from the Biofilm Layer
    Strains grown on Kanamycin plates extracted from the Planktonic Layer 
    Strains grown on Kanamycin plates extracted from the Biofilm Layer
    
    
Follow protocols to grow the strains in co-cultures and count the colonies on your spot plates
once the LOG(10) CFU/mL is calculated format a cvs file to the data shown above and the codes will work.
